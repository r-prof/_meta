# gprofiler

The goal of gprofiler is to assist profiling R packages that include native code (C++, C, Fortran, ...).
It collects profiling output simultaneously using [Rprof](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.3.2/topics/Rprof) and [gperftools](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools) and provides a unified view of profiling data.
At present this is but a feasibility study: it requires Ubuntu Linux 64-bit and the `libgoogle-perftools-dev` package.


## Example

The following example writes the `iris` data 100 times to an in-memory SQLite database and collects profiling data.
By default, the profiling data are collected in two files, `1.prof` (native) and `1.prof.out` (R).

```{r}
library(DBI)

gprofiler::start_profiler()
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
invisible(lapply(1:100, function(x)
  dbWriteTable(con, paste0("iris", x), iris)))
dbDisconnect(con)
gprofiler::stop_profiler()
```

A unified view is created with `get_profiler_traces()`. Currently this returns a nested data frame with two list columns, one for the native trace and one for the R trace. Each row represents one sample:

```{r}
gprofiler::get_profiler_traces()
```


Below is another example where an R function calls a C++ function that calls back into R.

```{r}
gprofiler::start_profiler()
gprofiler::callback2_r()
gprofiler::stop_profiler()
gprofiler::get_profiler_traces()
```

Eventually, the result will be an `Rprof`-compatible data format which can be consumed by `profvis` and other existing packages.
